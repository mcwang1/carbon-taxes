TITLE
Notes on Carbon Taxes: Competitiveness, Leakage, Border Adjustments, and Welfare Effects

STRUCTURE
Develop and implement (in Matlab) a model intermediate in complexity between a thought experiment and a CGE in order to demonstrate a set of intuitions and conclusions about carbon taxes, touching on several oft-mentioned and oft-confused topics. A companion paper to Kortum and Weisbach, NTJ that introduces theoretical underpinnings outside the scope of the other article.

GOAL
The goal of this paper is to refine the thinking of both researchers and policymakers as the field continues to discuss economically sound ways to combat climate change.

SECTION 1 THE MODEL

SUBSECTION 1 SETUP
[unimportant point?] At a given level of world emissions reduction, the expected standard of living (welfare) in the world is maximized when all countries charge a carbon tax and the tax rates are the same.

SUBSECTION 2 EQUIVALENCE RESULTS
1. A production tax with full border adjustments is equivalent to a consumption tax.
2. A harmonized worldwide carbon price is equivalent whether implemented on production or consumption.
3. If there is no trade in manufacturing (but there is trade in energy), unilateral production and consumption taxes are equivalent.

SUBSECTION 3 CONNECTIONS TO THE LITERATURE
1. Whether imposed on production or consumption, a carbon tax lowers the world energy price, corresponding to decreased world emissions; the resulting ceteris paribus increase in both home and foreign energy production and consumption is known as the "fossil fuel price effect" or the "energy price channel."

2. The concept of leakage refers to a consequence resulting exclusively from a tax on production: specifically, making production more expensive at home enhances foreign's comparative advantage in manufactures, expanding foreign's production. This is known as the "competitiveness effect" or "pollution haven channel."

SECTION 2 IMPLICATIONS
5. The combination of price increases due to taxes, the fossil fuel price effect, and the competitiveness effect cause the following:
A unilateral production tax lowers consumption worldwide, decreases home production, and increases foreign production.
A unilateral consumption tax lowers production worldwide, decreases home consumption, and increases foreign consumption. (theory/quantitative)

6. There is no clear relationship between leakage and home or world welfare. (quantitative)

7. Home must articulate its welfare goal - specifically, whether it seeks to maximize its own welfare or world welfare in expectation. The two goals call for different taxing schemes. (quantitative)
